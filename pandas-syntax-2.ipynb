       "  'Does anyone know of papers books etc  that document patterns for databases   For example  one common rule of thumb is that every table should have a primary key and that the key should be devoid of information content   So I was wondering if anyone had written a book or published papers regarding design patterns for designing relational databases      Gaius   That is the question that a database designer needs to weigh  what is the probable stability of the database structure   Given a long enough horizon nothing is stable  Or to say the converse  given a long enough horizon  everything is subject to change   A surrogate key  in theory  should never change its meaning because it never had meaning to begin with     I guess the other thing to consider in that particular design scenario is who is it that will be seeing the primary key   If the primary key is something that end users will actually need to refer to then it makes sense to make it something they can understand   But I can t think of many cases where an end user needs to see a primary key  usually the primary key is present to allow the DB engine to speed up certain operations   My original thought in asking the question was to find design patterns for database design that were codified by more experienced database designers than myself so as to  hopefully  avoid some easily avoidable errors   It would be interesting reading if anyone had ever codified database design anti patterns   '],\n",

       "  'Ruby setters—whether created by  c attr accessor or manually—seem to be the only methods that need self  qualification when accessed within the class itself   This seems to put Ruby alone the world of languages    All methods need self this  like Perl  and I think Javascript  No methods require self this is  C   Java  Only setters need self this  Ruby     The best comparison is C  vs Ruby  because both languages support accessor methods which work syntactically just like class instance variables  foo x   y  y   foo x   C  calls them properties   Here s a simple example  the same program in Ruby then C    class A   def qwerty   q  end                     manual getter   def qwerty  value    q   value  end     manual setter  but attr accessor is same    def asdf  self qwerty   4  end           self   is necessary in ruby    def xxx  asdf  end                      we can invoke nonsetters w o  self     def dump  puts  qwerty     qwerty    end end  a   A new a xxx a dump   take away the self qwerty     and it fails  Ruby 1 8 6 on Linux  amp  OS X    Now C    using System   public class A     public A        int q    public int qwerty       get   return q        set   q   value          public void asdf     qwerty   4       C  setters work w o  this     public void xxx      asdf             are just like other methods   public void dump     Console WriteLine  qwerty

self is necessary  I e   are there other occasions where a Ruby method cannot be invoked without self   There are certainly lots of cases where self becomes necessary   This is not unique to Ruby  just to be clear   using System   public class A     public A        public int test   get   return 4       public int useVariable         int test   5      return test        public int useMethod

   a useMethod          prints 4         Same ambiguity is resolved in same way   But while subtle I m asking about the case where    A method has been defined  and No local variable has been defined  and   we encounter  qwerty   4   which is ambiguous—is this a method invocation or an new local variable assignment      Mike Stone  Hi   I understand and appreciate the points you ve made and your  example was great   Believe me when I say  if I had enough reputation  I d vote up your response   Yet we still disagree     on a matter of semantics  and on a central point of fact   First I claim  not without irony  we re having a semantic debate about the  meaning of  ambiguity    When it comes to parsing and programming language semantics  the subject  of this question   surely you would admit a broad spectrum of the notion   ambiguity    Let s just adopt some random notation     ambiguous  lexical ambiguity  lex must  look ahead   Ambiguous  grammatical ambiguity  yacc must defer to parse tree analysis  AMBIGUOUS  ambiguity knowing everything at the moment of execution    and there s junk between 2 3 too    All these categories are resolved by  gathering more contextual info  looking more and more globally   So when you  say       qwerty   4  is UNAMBIGUOUS in C    when there is no variable defined      I couldn t agree more   But by the same token  I m saying       qwerty   4  is un Ambiguous in ruby    as it now exists        qwerty   4  is Ambiguous in C    And we re not yet contradicting each other   Finally  here s where we really  disagree  Either ruby could or could not be implemented without any further  language constructs such that      For  qwerty   4   ruby UNAMBIGUOUSLY   invokes an existing setter if there   is no local variable defined   You say no   I say yes  another ruby could exist which behaves exactly like  the current in every respect  except  qwerty   4  defines a new  variable when no setter and no local exists  it invokes the setter if one  exists  and it assigns to the local if one exists   I fully accept that I  could be wrong   In fact  a reason why I might be wrong would be interesting   Let me explain   Imagine you are writing a new OO language with accessor methods looking like instances vars  like ruby  amp  C     You d probably start with  conceptual grammars something like     var   expr       assignment   method   expr    setter method invocation   But the parser compiler  not even the runtime  will puke  because even after all the input is grokked there s no way to know which grammar is pertinent  You re faced which a classic choice   I can t be sure of the details  but basically ruby does this     var   expr       assignment  new or existing       method   expr  disallow setter method invocation without     that is why it s un Ambiguous  while and C  does this     symbol   expr    push  symbol   onto parse tree and decide later                    if local variable is def d somewhere in scope  assignment                    else if a setter is def d in scope  invocation   For C    later  is still at compile time   I m sure ruby could do the same  but  later  would have to be at runtime  because  as ben points out you don t know until the statement is executed which case  applies   My question was never intended to mean  do I really need the  self     or  what  potential ambiguity is being avoided    Rather I wanted to know why was this particular choice made   Maybe it s not performance   Maybe it just got the job done  or it was considered best to always allow a 1 liner local to override a  method  a pretty rare case requirement       But I m sort of suggesting that the most dynamical language might be the one which postpones this decision the longest  and chooses semantics based on the most contextual  info  so if you have no local and you defined a setter  it would use the setter   Isn t  this why we like ruby  smalltalk  objc  because method invocation is decided at runtime
